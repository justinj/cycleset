CycleSet
========

An introduction to the concept of a [Cycle Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_space).

What am I looking at?
=====================

CycleSet is a game of linear algebra and graph theory, where the goal is to find a nonempty
collection of the subgraphs you are presented with whose symmetric difference is the graph with no
edges.
That sounds a lot more complicated than it is - click around for a few minutes and you should get
the idea.

Problems
========

Currently `purescript-react` doesn't support SVG DOM properties, so this is using a modified
version of `purescript-react`, [`DOM.purs`](https://gist.github.com/justinj/58092f01bdd0b272e66a).
